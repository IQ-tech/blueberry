# Iq Blueberry Design System

The Iq Design System (Blueberry) came to bring a series of benefits and to solve a series of common problems in the Iq development workflow.

### The main benefits are:

- Keep visual consistency between components, pages and projects
- Create easily maintainable components
- Develop a common language between Design and Front-end teams
- Single source of truth to style code
- Share code between Iq applications
- Faster development of pages and features (keeping quality and isolation of code)
- Using css as base, the consumer applications can use almost any technology or framework such as React and css-in-js libraries

### Detailing the main workflow problems to be solved:

- Code rewriting
  - There are lots of React components already coded, but they are hard to modify and to be found in the codebase
  - 100% of the code is rewritten on different applications that use different technologies (Ex: React, Pug), with the design system we can share style (css) code
  - Some visual rules are rewritten every new layout, such as paddings, containers, alignment...
- Inconsistent layouts and components
  - Layout breaking on specific breakpoints
  - Pages and components with old styles that doesn't reflect the current state of the product
  - Non standard styles and animations
