# Iq Blueberry Design System

The Iq Design System (Blueberry) came to bring a series of benefits and to solve a series of common problems in the Iq development workflow.

The main benefits are:
* Visual consistency between components, pages and projects
* Easily maintanable components
* Common language between Design and Front-end teams
* Single source of truth to style code
* Share code between Iq applications
* Faster development of pages and features (keeping quality)




Deta:
* Code rewriting
	* Components already coded, but unknown and hard to find in the codebase
	* 100% code rewriting on different applications that use different technologies (Ex: React, Pug)
* Inconsistent layouts and components
	* Layout breaking on specific breakpoints
	* Pages with old styles
	* Non standard styles and animations
